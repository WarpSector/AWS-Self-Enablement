# Domain 1: Cloud Concepts
# (1E: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs))

## Overview
  * APIs are **integral** to the Cloud.
  * APIs essentially are "interfaces" that let computer programs "talk to" each other using a set of rules and protocols.
  * APIs assist with sharing information and data between computer programs (software).
  * **API Calls:** This is when you perform an action to get different computer programs to "talk to each other" whether pushing a button or typing in a command in the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
  * APIs are written in code (namely **Python**) that build the interface and program the set of rules/protocols for computer programs to talk to each other.

## Every action you take in the AWS Cloud is an API call!
