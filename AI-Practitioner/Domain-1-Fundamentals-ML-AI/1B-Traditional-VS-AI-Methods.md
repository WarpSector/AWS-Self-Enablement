# Domain 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
# (1B: Traditional Methods vs. Artificial Intelligence Methods for Problem-Solving)

## The Axioms
### Do you need ML to solve this problem or can you solve it using traditional code?
#### Not Always Necessary
* AI and ML are not required for every problem.
#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
* Assessing the cost-benefit of using (or not using) ML to solve a problem.
#### Start Simple
* If using ML, save time and resources by starting simple and then scaling.
#### Align with Goals
* Ensure the technology matches to business needs.

## Cost-Optimization Pillar (Well-Architected Framework)
* Identify if ML is suitable for your specific problem.
* Not every challenge requires a ML approach when it can be solved with traditional algorithms or simple rule-based systems can achieve the desired outcomes more cost-effectively.
* Perform a trade-off analysis between custom vs. pre-trained models (pre-trained models are more cost-effective since they've already been trained and required fine tuning).

## Framing the ML Problem
* Best practices to consider before adopting ML solutions.
* Clearly defining the problem you're trying to solve, identifying the most relevant data sources, and choosing the right algorithms and models.

## Is ML the Right Solution?
* **YES - When you cannot code the rules:**
    * When rules depend on too many factors and many of these rules overlap or need to be tuned very finely, you may need an ML solution.
* **YES - When you cannot scale:**
    * ML solutions are effective at handling large-scale problems.
* **EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES:**
    * If simple rule-based approaches (code) can be more effective to solve the problem.
    * Consider if ML will add unnecessary complexity. 
* **Weighing Costs:**
    * Cost of adopting ML vs. Opportunity cost of not using ML.
    * Specialized resources can be expensive and limited.

## When AI/ML may NOT be Appropriate
### Situations Requiring Specific Outcomes
  * Need for exact, deterministic results over predictions.
  * Example: Compliance checks, fixed logic operations.
### Cost-Benefit Analysis
  * High costs may outweigh benefits in some scenarios.
  * Assess if ML provides significant value addition.

## Specialized Resource Constraints
### Human Resources
  * Data Scientists time is costly and limited for training models.
  * Model development and time-to-market considerations.
### Hardware Choices
  * Cost-effective hardware might limit experimentation speed.
  * Balance between cost and development efficiency.
